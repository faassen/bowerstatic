0.5 (unreleased)
================

- Do not crash when a version information is missing in bower.json.


0.4 (2014-09-08)
================

- There was a bug in the new ``component(name)`` method to obtain the
  component, because it wouldn't work for local components. Fixing this
  properly took a significant refactoring:

  * the ComponentCollection gains its own fallback behavior, much
    simpler to implement than in LocalComponentCollection.

  * UrlComponent is now gone and Component gains that functionality; it
    keeps a reference to the collection itself now.

  * add a lot of free-standing functions to the methods.

  * an earlier hack passing the component collection through an argument
    is now gone.

- The new ``.component()`` API to get a component from a collection
  explicitly in order to get its URL is gone again as it conflicted
  with an earlier API on local component collections. Instead use
  ``collection.get_component(name)``.

0.3 (2014-08-28)
================

- BowerStatic failed to initialize if a component was discovered
  without a ``main``. These are handled now -- if you try to include a
  path to such a resource, no extra inclusions are generated. Fixes #5.

- If ``main`` was an array, only the first such resource was
  loaded. The correct behavior should be to load all these
  resources. This required a reworking of how resources get created;
  instead of creating a single resource for a path, a list of
  resources is created everywhere. Fixes #6 (and was mentioned in #5).

- Introduce a ``component(name)`` method on the components
  object. Given a component name it will give an object that has a
  ``url()`` method.  This can be used to obtain the URL of a component
  directory, which is sometimes useful when client-side code needs to
  construct URLs itself, such as for templates. Fixes issue #8.

- You can register a renderer for a particular extension type using,
  for example, ``bower.renderer('.js', render_js)``, where
  ``render_js`` takes a URL and should return a string with a HTML
  snippet to include on the page.

0.2 (2014-07-18)
================

- Even if the same resource is included multiple times, it will only
  be included once. Thanks Ying Zhong for the bug report and suggested
  fix.

0.1 (2014-07-07)
================

- Initial public release.
